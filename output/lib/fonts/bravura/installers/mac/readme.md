# Packages installer project

This is a simple OS X installer script to install Bravura and Bravura Text, which:

* Installs the OpenType versions of Bravura and Bravura Text into the system font folder (`/Library/Fonts`).
* Installs the font-specific JSON metadata files into `/Library/Application Support/SMuFL/Fonts/Bravura/`
* Installs the OFL license, OFL FAQ, font log, and documentation for Bravura Text into the same folder.

This project can be modified to install other SMuFL-compliant fonts.
